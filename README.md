# express-graphql

SpaceX App loosely following Traversy Media's GraphQL Course:
- Uses Express, React, Appolo and GraphQl

Updates:
- Using the new Apollo Client via useQuery()
- Adding <Switch> to router
- omitting classnames library in favour of just using a turnary
- used Date-fns rather than moment 
- Only used functional components
- Used a neumorphic bootswatch theme because why not :)
